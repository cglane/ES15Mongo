# MongoDB ES15 App

TODO: MEAN stack application for storing language key translations for a website, uses ECMA2015 dependecy injection,
multiple MongoDB connections, MongoDB Aggregation, AngularJS, Sockets, and AWS uploading .

## History

TODO: Needed an integrated system to store customer custom translations as static files, but also have ability to
easily change translations. The result was a mongodb storage system that aggregated
custom translations with default product translations, providing an easy UI that product managers 
could use to change translations per client requests.
